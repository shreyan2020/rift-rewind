  "lore": "The sun sets over the Demacian walls, casting long shadows upon the cobblestone streets. Amidst the clatter of swords and the rhythmic thump of hammers, a summoner named Kaelin prepares for battle in the King's League. Kaelin, a steadfast champion of tradition and a devoted seeker of power, dons his enchanted armor and readies his spells, the security of his homeland's values fueling his resolve. The scent of roasting meats and the sound of laughter from nearby taverns are but distant memories as Kaelin steps into the Rift, ready to defend Demacia and uphold its proud legacy.",
