  "lore": "In the heart of Piltover, our summoner found solace amidst the city's perpetual hum of innovation. With a Self-Directed spirit, they built a small laboratory, nestled between the towering hextech spires. Benevolent at heart, they shared their discoveries, teaching local scholars and inventors. Tradition bound, they respected the ancient knowledge of the Piltover Academy, merging it with their own groundbreaking research. Amidst the clatter of gears and the hiss of steam, our summoner's lab became a beacon of progress and unity.",
