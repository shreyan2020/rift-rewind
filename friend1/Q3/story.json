  "lore": "As the sun set over the Noxian battlefields, the summoner's tent stood proudly amidst the chaos. The ground shook with the thunderous roar of the Noxian military, their iron will and unyielding resolve echoing in every heartbeat. The summoner, a master of power, knew the value of security in a land torn apart by war. As they prepared their next summon, a sense of tradition washed over them, the weight of Noxus' history pressing upon their shoulders. The summoner closed their eyes, focusing on the essence of the Runes, the lifeblood of their power. The world around them faded, replaced by the ethereal realm of the Rune Wars, where the fate of Runeterra was decided, one battle at a time.",
  "reflection": "Based on the provided performance stats, the player's low CS/min (1.27) is a significant area for improvement. To boost their CS/min, they should practice last-hitting effectively and focus on securing CS efficiently in lanes and during team fights.",
